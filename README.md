# WormTracker v1.0


A website built using react that allows the user to load an image and overlay a grid for counting worm tracks on an agar plate.

### How to use:

1. Make sure image is in a web usable format (jpg, jpeg, png etc. (not TIFF)). Most websites can convert these, there are plenty of websites that can do this for you or you can go into paint and save as png; (you can screenshot the image, but may affect image quality when zoomed) 
2. Upload picture to some public web server, in my examples I send my pictures on a discord channel and copy the link and paste it into the image link text box on the website.

<img src="/screenshots/2.png"  width="40%">
<img src="/screenshots/3.png" width="40%">
<img src="/screenshots/4.png" width="40%">

3. Set X and Y start points with the sliders, then set height and width to adjust the other 2 sides of the grid
4. Click squares with worm tracks in, they will change to green. Note, a count of squares is displayed in the menu.

I would recommend zooming in, on chrome you can do this with CTRL (windows) / CMD (mac) + Scroll Up / +. Once zoomed in you can navigate round with the scroll bars or the scroll or Shift + scroll for vertical and horizontal scrolling respectively. 
If you are zoomed in the menu can cause formatting issues, so it automatically dissapears once you are too zoomed in. If it gets in the way before it 
disappears hit the 'hide menu' button to close it and deselect to re-open.

To use this website you have to make sure the height of your browser is over 700px, sorry phone users! (but there's no saving you if you're using a phone to count worm tracks)
